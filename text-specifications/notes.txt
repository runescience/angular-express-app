hello, i want to make an angular program that uses Express.js endpoints to switch for navigating screens and rest api. this angular app has 2 components. Esch-list, and Support-list. these links are in a <div> container at the top of each page so the user cna switchfrom page to page buy clicking the endpoint links. Each angular component lists things out of a jsondb. need detailed including ng generate etc

 for teams component, I would like to do CRUD screens using sqlite, and orm. in the db, use uuid-4[:8] for id, teamname, author, createdon, updatedon, isActive boolean. crud Read is a list of rows that have add and delete button, add/edit screen on each row
Use uuid-4[:8] for id, teamname, author, createdon, updatedon, isActive boolean. 

for option-lists,I would like to do CRUD screens using sqlite typeorm, and orm. 

in the db, use uuid-4[:8] for id,
name  nullable=False
listdata  nullable=False
version  nullable=True
supercedes  nullable=True
author = nullable=False

I would like to do that using the  shared base and components paradigm you listed. see your code in  shared/components/list-container/list-container.component.ts,modal.component.css, shared/components/modal/modal.component.ts, etc
