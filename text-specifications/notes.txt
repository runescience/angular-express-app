hello, i want to make an angular program that uses Express.js endpoints to switch for navigating screens and rest api. this angular app has 2 components. Esch-list, and Support-list. these links are in a <div> container at the top of each page so the user cna switchfrom page to page buy clicking the endpoint links. Each angular component lists things out of a jsondb. need detailed including ng generate etc

 for teams component, I would like to do CRUD screens using sqlite, and orm. in the db, use uuid-4[:8] for id, teamname, author, created_on, updated_on, is_active boolean. crud Read is a list of rows that have add and delete button, add/edit screen on each row
Use uuid-4[:8] for id, teamname, author, created_on, updated_on, is_active boolean. 

for option-lists,I would like to do CRUD screens using sqlite typeorm, and orm. 

in the db, use uuid-4[:8] for id,
name  nullable=False
listdata  nullable=False
version  nullable=True
supercedes  nullable=True
author = nullable=False

I would like to do that using the  shared base and components paradigm you listed. see your code in  shared/components/list-container/list-container.component.ts,modal.component.css, shared/components/modal/modal.component.ts, etc



Similar to teams compoent, I would like a new update for option-lists, that has CRUD capability for using sqlite, and typeorm. For listing, adding, updating deleting records for option-lists

in the team db, new table list-options. use uuid-4[:8] for id
name nullable=False, list_data nullable=False
version nullable=True, supercedes nullable=True,
author = nullable=False

use these files, to copy the structure and content into updates for the option-lists files: @teams.components.html, has list and modal form, to aid user in showing rows, and adding updating new rows. @teams.components.ts, @teams.entity.ts, @teams.interface.ts, @teams.service.ts

Similar to teams component, I would like to update the question-type components, that support CRUD capability using sqlite, and typeorm. there is a table and endoints in @server.js already in place. 

question_type_id Primary Key, uuid-4[:8]
type TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
is_active INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
has_regex INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
regex_str TEXT,
has_options INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
options_str TEXT,
has_supplemental INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
supplemental_str TEXT,
created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
author TEXT

use these files, to copy the structure and content into updates for the option-lists files: @teams.components.html, has list and modal form, to aid user in showing rows, and adding updating new rows. @teams.components.ts, @teams.entity.ts, @teams.interface.ts, @teams.service.ts all have strucure to implement the @question-type components.

#================================
Similar to teams component, I would like a new update for the question-type, that has CRUD capability for using sqlite, and typeorm. For listing, adding, updating deleting records for question-type

in the team db, new table question_types, as follows
class QuestionType(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = 'question_types'

    question_type_id = db.Column(db.String,
                                 primary_key=True,
                                 default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4())[:8])
    # Primary Key

    type = db.Column(db.String, unique=True,
                     nullable=False)  # Type of question
    is_active = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=True)  # Active flag
    has_regex = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)  # Regex support flag
    regex_str = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)  # Regex string

    has_options = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)  # Options flag
    options_str = db.Column(
        db.String, nullable=True)  # Options string in CSV or JSON format

    has_supplemental = db.Column(
        db.Boolean, default=False)  # Supplemental information flag
    supplemental_str = db.Column(
        db.String, nullable=True)  # Supplemental information string

    created_at = db.Column(db.DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at = db.Column(db.DateTime,
                           default=datetime.utcnow,
                           onupdate=datetime.utcnow)
    author = db.Column(db.String, nullable=True)  # Author of the QuestionType

    # Relationship with Question, enabling bi-directional access
    questions = db.relationship('Question', backref='question_type', lazy=True)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<QuestionType {self.type}>"


use these files, to copy the structure and content into updates for the question-type files: @teams.components.html, has list and modal form, to aid user in showing rows, and adding updating new rows. @teams.components.ts, @teams.entity.ts, @teams.interface.ts, @teams.service.ts

the name of the db file for sqlite3 is teams.db
