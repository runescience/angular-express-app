updating this
Two main components:

    Esch-list component

    Support-list component

    Navigation links in a div container at the top for switching between pages

Teams component with CRUD operations using:

    SQLite database

    TypeORM

    Schema with:

        uuid-4:8 for id

        teamname

        author

        created_on

        updated_on

        is_active (boolean)

    List view with add/delete buttons

    Add/edit screen for each row

The options-list and shared components have been removed from the requirements.

Would you like me to help you with:

    Setting up the initial Angular project structure

    Creating the Express.js backend with SQLite/TypeORM

    Implementing the navigation and components

    Setting up the CRUD operations for the Teams component

Which part would you like to start with
